This repository contains the MIPS code I developed during my Computer Architecture course in the fall of 2022. The class focused on MIPS assembly language, which communicates directly with a computer's hardware, providing a 
low-level programming experience distinct from high-level languages like Python or Java. Throughout the course, I learned the critical importance of memory management and efficient register usage in MIPS, as improper 
handling can lead to significant issues. We delved into various topics, including instruction pipelining, which optimizes CPU performance by overlapping instruction execution; cache memory, which enhances data retrieval 
speed; and interrupts, which handle asynchronous events crucial for responsive systems. The labs required translating complex algorithms into MIPS assembly, offering a hands-on understanding of how hardware processes these 
instructions. This experience underscored the challenges and intricacies of low-level programming, such as the need for meticulous attention to detail and adherence to coding conventions to avoid common pitfalls. To run the 
programs in this repository, install the MARS simulator, copy the code into a new file, and execute it within the MARS environment. This repository showcases my exploration of MIPS assembly, highlighting the practical 
applications of theoretical computer architecture concepts.
